# GOID (GOG Offline Installer Downloader)
GOID is an attempt at a script to automatically check for updates in your game library using the GOG API. If a newer version is detected, it automatically downloads the offline installer and replaces the older version with the newer version.

This is my first project and first attempt at using Python, as well as my first time playing around with an API. If you have any improvements you'd like to suggest, feel free to do so!

## Installation
You can simply run main.py or the executable provided in the "releases" section.
